1n2ah3q,Starting to look at Datawarehouses/lakehouse,"Hi

  
I have been involved in our business implementing Business Central ERP and we are currently pushing all of our data to an SQL database for reporting to Power BI (Which has been completely fine). We are reaching a point with new software coming in that we will need (i think anyway) a data warehouse to collate the data from different sources in one place to allow for easier Power BI Reporting.

  
What are the best sources to look at for where to begin on this topic? I have been watching youtube videos but in terms of what product is best I haven't found much. I think anything like Snowflake would be overkill for us (We are a £100m construction company in the UK) - our largest table after 1 year of erp has 1.5m rows, so not enormous data.

  
Any direction on where to start on this would be great",1,Affectionate-Comb-88,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1n2ah3q/starting_to_look_at_datawarehouseslakehouse/,2025-08-28 12:08:59

1n28xll,I built Runcell - an AI agent for Jupyter that actually understands your notebook context,"I've been working on something called Runcell that I think fills a gap I was frustrated with in existing AI coding tools.

**What it is:** Runcell is an AI agent that lives inside JupyterLab and can understand the full context of your notebook - your data, charts, previous code, kernel state, etc. Instead of just generating code, it can actually edit and execute specific cells, read/write files, and take actions on its own.

**Why I built it:** I tried Cursor and Claude Code, but they mostly just generate a bunch of cells at once without really understanding what happened in previous steps. When I'm doing data science work, I usually need to look at the results from one cell before deciding what to write next. That's exactly what Runcell does - it analyzes your previous results and decides what code to run next based on that context.

**How it's different:**

* vs AI IDEs like Cursor: Runcell focuses specifically on building context for Jupyter environments instead of treating notebooks like static files
* vs Jupyter AI: Runcell is more of an autonomous agent rather than just a chatbot - it has tools to actually work and take actions

You can try it with just `pip install runcell`. or find more install guide for this jupyter lab extension: [https://www.runcell.dev/download](https://www.runcell.dev/download)

I'm looking for feedback from the community. Has anyone else felt this frustration with existing tools? Does this approach make sense for your workflow?",3,Sudden_Beginning_597,351,https://v.redd.it/m6hanf0opqlf1,2025-08-28 10:49:02
1n28cef,Dataiku DSS: The Low-Code Data Engineering King or Just Another ETL Tool?,"I’ve been working with Dataiku quite extensively over the past few years, mostly in enterprise environments. What struck me is how much it positions itself as a “low-code” or even “no-code” platform for data engineering — while still offering the ability to drop into Python, SQL, or Spark when needed.

Some observations from my experience:

* Strengths: Fast onboarding for non-technical profiles, strong collaboration features (flow zones, data catalog, lineage), decent governance, and easy integration with cloud & big data stacks.
* Limitations: Sometimes the abstraction layer can feel restrictive for advanced use cases, version control is not always as smooth as in pure code-based pipelines, and debugging can be tricky compared to writing transformations directly in Spark/SQL.

This made me wonder:

* For those of you working in data engineering, do you see platforms like Dataiku (and others in the same category: Alteryx, KNIME, Talend, etc.) as serious contenders in the data engineering space, or more as tools for “citizen data scientists” and analysts?
* Do you think low-code platforms will ever replace traditional code-based data engineering workflows, or will they always stay complementary?",0,Madal13,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1n28cef/dataiku_dss_the_lowcode_data_engineering_king_or/,2025-08-28 10:14:28

1n1ptjq,Medallion Architecture and DBT Structure,"Context: This is for doing data analytics, especially when working with multiple data sources and needing to do things like building out mapping tables.

Just wondering what others think about structuring their workflow something like this:

1. Raw (Bronze): Source data and simple views like renaming, parsing, casting columns.
2. Staging (Bronze): Further cleaned datasets. I often end up finding that there needs to be a lot of additional work done on top of source data, such as joining tables together, building out incremental models on top of the source data, filtering out bad data, etc. It's still ultimately viewing the source data, but can have significantly more logic than just the raw layer.
3. Catalog (Silver): Datasets people are going to use. These are not always just whatever is from the source data, it can start to be things like joining different data sources together to create more complex stuff, but they are generally not report specific (you can create whatever reports off of them).
4. Reporting (Gold): Datasets that are more report specific. This is usually something like aggregated, unioned, denormalized datasets.

Overall folder structure might be something like this:

* raw
   * source\_A
   * source\_B
* staging
   * source\_A
   * source\_B
   * intermediate
* catalog
   * business\_domain\_1
   * business\_domain\_2
   * intermediate
* reporting
   * report\_X
   * report\_Y
   * intermediate

Historically, the raw layer above was our staging layer, the staging layer above was an intermediate layer, and all intermediate steps were done in the same intermediate folder, which I feel has become unnecessarily tangled as we've scaled up.",9,simplybeautifulart,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1n1ptjq/medallion_architecture_and_dbt_structure/,2025-08-27 18:58:00

1n1kv37,First Data Engineering Project. Built a Congressional vote tracker. How did I do?,"Github: [https://github.com/Lbongard/congress\_pipeline](https://github.com/Lbongard/congress_pipeline)

Streamlit App: [https://congress-pipeline-4347055658.us-central1.run.app/](https://congress-pipeline-4347055658.us-central1.run.app/)

For context, I’m a Data Analyst looking to learn more about Data Engineering. I’ve been working on this project on-and-off for a while, and I thought I would see what [r/DE](https://www.reddit.com/r/DE/) thinks.

The basics of the pipeline are as follows, orchestrated with Airflow:

1. Download and extract bill data from [Congress.gov](http://congress.gov/) bulk data page, unzip it in my local environment (Google Compute VM in prod) and concatenate into a few files for easier upload to GCS. Obviously not scalable for bigger data, but seems to work OK here
2. Extract url of voting results listed in each bill record, download voting results from url, convert from xml to json and upload to GCS
3. In parallel, extract member data from [Congress.gov](http://congress.gov/) API, concatenate, upload to GCS
4. Create external tables with airflow operator then staging and dim/fact tables with dbt
5. Finally, export aggregated views (gold layer if you will) to a schema that feeds a Streamlit app.

A few observations / questions that came to mind:

\- To create an external table in BigQuery for each data type, I have to define a consistent schema for each type. This was somewhat of a trial-and-error process to understand how to organize the schema in a way that worked for all records. Not to mention instances when incoming data had a slightly different schema than the existing data. Is there a way that I could have improved this process?

\- In general, is my DAG too bloated? Would it be best practice to separate my different data sources (members, bills, votes) into different DAGs?

https://preview.redd.it/153iiz683llf1.png?width=2158&format=png&auto=webp&s=31e735c54db6bf536fa52d7f8e4fa246feb62f7b

\- I probably over-engineered aspects of this project. For example, I’m not sure I need an IaC tool. I also could have likely skipped the external tables and gone straight to a staging table for each data type. The Streamlit app is definitely high latency, but seems to work OK once the data is loaded. Probably not the best for this use case, but I wanted to practice Streamlit because it’s applicable to my day job.

Thank you if you’ve made it this far. There are definitely lots of other minor things that I could ask about, but I’ve tried to keep it to the biggest point in this post.

1n1hy4g,How do you handle your BI setup when users constantly want to drill-down on your datasets?,"Background: 
We are a retailer with hundreds of thousands of items. We are heavily invested in databricks and power bi

Problem: 
Our business users want to drilldown, slice, and re-aggregate across upc, store, category, department, etc. it’s the perfect usecase for a cube, but we don’t have that. Our data model is too large to fit entirely into power bi memory, even with vertipaq compression and 400gb of memory. 

For reference, we are somewhere between 750gb-1tb depending on compression. 

The solution to this point is direct query on an XL SQL warehouse which is essentially running nonstop due to the SLAs we have. This is costing a fortune. 

Solutions thought of:
- Pre aggregation: great in thought, unfortunately too many possibilities to pre calculate 

- Onelake: Microsoft of course suggested this to our leadership, and though this does enable fitting the data ‘in memory’, it would be expensive as well, and I personally don’t think power bi is designed for drill downs

- Clickhouse: this seems like it might be better designed for the task at hand, and can still be integrated into power bi. Columnar, with some heavy optimizations. Open source is a plus. 

Also considered: Druid, SSAS (concerned about long term support plus other things)

Im not sure if I’m falling for marketing with Clickhouse or if it really would make the most sense here. What am I missing? 

EDIT: i appreciate the thoughts this far. The theme of responses has been to pushback or change process.

1n0x7jm,We're building a database of every company in the world (265M+ so far),"Hey r/dataengineering!

**Hit this at every company I've worked at:** ""Apple Corp"" from an invoice - which of the 47 Apple companies is this actually referring to? Found enterprises paying teams of 10+ people overseas just to research company names because nothing automated works at scale. 

**What we're working on:** Company database and matching API for messy, real-world data. Behind the scenes we're integrating with government business registries globally - every country does this differently and it's a nightmare. Going for a Stripe/Twilio approach to abstract away the mess. 

**Current stats:**

* 265M companies across 107 countries 
* 92% accuracy vs \~58% for traditional tools 
* Returns confidence scores, not black-box results

**Honestly struggling with one thing:** This feels like foundational infrastructure every data team needs, but it's hard to quantify business impact until you actually clean up your data. Classic ""engineering knows this is a huge time sink, but executives don't see it"" situation.

* How big of a pain point is company matching for your team? 
* Anyone dealt with selling infrastructure improvements up the chain?

I’ve built end-to-end pipelines and gained solid experience, but lately I feel like I’m not learning much new.

In my current company, I’m also a bit unsure about my growth. The work is fine, but it feels very similar to what I’ve already been doing, and I’m not sure if I’m getting the kind of exposure I need at this stage of my career.

On my own, I’ve tried to expand my skills into other big data tools like Hive, Hadoop, Kafka, and Airflow. I’ve learned them independently and even done small projects, but unfortunately, I haven’t been able to land roles in companies that use these newer tools more extensively. I really want to work on them seriously, but not being able to break into those opportunities has been a bit stressful, and I’m not sure how to approach it.

I’ve also started preparing for an AWS certification, since many product-based companies and startups seem to prefer AWS, and I feel this might give me better opportunities.

At the same time, I wonder if I’m overthinking this or being too quick to judge my situation.

I like the idea of DataEng but have major imposter syndrome, as everything I have done in my current roles have been quite simple (IMO). In my role today I am writing a lot of SQL some simple queries some complicated ones, I write Python for scripting but don’t use many OOP python.

I have wrote a lot of mini ETLs that pick files up from either S3 (boto3) or sftp (paramiko) and used tools such as pandas to clean the data and either send on to another location or store in a table.

I have wrote my own ETLs which I have posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1g1w57v/opinions_on_my_first_etl_be_kind/) - [Github Link](https://github.com/mrpbennett/etl-pipeline) before. This got some good praise but still….imposter syndrome.

I have my own Homelab where I have setup up Cloudnative Postgres, Trino and in the process of setting up Iceberg with something like Nessie. I also have minio setup for object storage.

I have started to go through [Mastery with SQL](https://www.masterywithsql.com/) as a basic refresher and to learn more about query optimisation and things like window functions.

Things I don’t quite understand is the whole data lake echo system and hdfs / parquet etc hence setting up Iceberg. As well as streaming with the likes of Kafka / Redpanda. This does seem quite complicated…I am yet to find a project to test things out.

This is my current plan to bolster my skill set and knowledge.

1. Finish Mastery of SQL
2. Dip in and out of Leetcode for SQL and Python
3. Finish setting up Iceberg in my K8s cluster
4. Learn about different databases (duckdb etc) 
5. Write more ETLs

1n0fbyg,Need advice: Automating daily customer data pipeline (Excel + CSV → deduplicated Excel output),"Hi all,

I’m a BI trainee at a bank and I need to provide daily customer data to another department. The tricky part is that the data comes from two different systems, and everything needs to be filtered and deduplicated before it lands in a final Excel file.

Here’s the setup:
General rule: In both systems, I only need data from the last business day.

Source 1 (Excel export from SAP BO / BI4):

We run a query in BI4 to pull all relevant columns.

Export to Excel.

A VBA macro compares the new data with a history file (also Excel) so that new entries neuer than 10 years based on CCID) are excluded.

The cleaned Excel is then placed automatically on a shared drive.


Source 2 (CSV):

Needs the same filter: last business day only.

only commercial customers are relevant (they can be identified by their legal form in one column).

This must also be compared against another history file (Excel again).

customers often appear multiple times with the same CCID (because several people are tied to one company), but I only need one row per CCID.

The issue:
I can use Python, but the history and outputs must still remain in Excel, since that’s what the other department uses. I’m confused about how to structure this properly. Right now I’m stuck between half-automated VBA hacks and trying to build something more robust in Python.

Questions:
What’s the cleanest way to set up this pipeline when the “database” is basically just Excel files?

How would you handle the deduplication logic (cross-history + internal CCID duplicates) in a clean way?

Is Python + Pandas the right approach here, or should I lean more into existing ETL tools?

I’d really appreciate some guidance or examples on how to build this properly — I’m getting a bit lost in Excel/VBA land.

Thanks!

1n0el52,BigQuery DWH - get rid of SCD2 tables -> daily partitioned tables ?,"Has anybody made the decision to get rid of SCD2 tables and convert them to daily partitioned tables in PROD in your DWH ?

Our DWH layers:

**Bronze**  
stage - 1:1 data from sources  
raw - SCD2 of stage  
clean\_hist - data types change, cols renaming etc.  
clean - current row of clean hist

**Silver**  
core - currently messy, going to be dimensional model (facts + SCD2 dims) + OBT when it makes sense more

**Gold**  
mart

We are going to remodel the core layer, the biggest issue is that **core** is created from **clean\_hist** and **clean** which contain SCD2 tables.

When joining these tables in **core**, BQ has huge problems with range joins, because it is not optimized for that.

So my question is whether anybody has made the choice to get rid of SCD2 tables in BQ and convert them to daily partitioned tables ? Like instead of SCD2 tables with e.g **dbt\_valid\_from** and **dbt\_valid\_to,** there would be just **date** column.

It would lead to massive increase of row counts but we could utilize partitioning on this column and because we use Dagster for orchestration it also make backfills easier (reload just 1 partition, change of history in SCD2 is more tricky) and we could also migrate the majority of dbt models to incremental ones.

It is basically the trade-off between storage and compute. (1 TB of storage costs 20 USD/month, whereas 1 TB of processed costs 6.25 USD and sometimes forcing BQ to utilize partition is not so straightforward (but we use capacity based pricing to utilize slots).

So my question is, has any body crossed the Rubicon and made this change ?",12,Borek79,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1n0el52/bigquery_dwh_get_rid_of_scd2_tables_daily/,2025-08-26 06:37:24

We’ve been using it for six months and I think it’s seriously underrated. I’ve tried Airflow, Dagster, and Prefect, but they always felt overcomplicated unless you’re managing hundreds of pipelines. I just wanted something simple: set up credentials, create pipelines, and kick off jobs.

Orchestra stood out for its **built-in integrations**:

* Power BI refreshes
* Running dbt Core as part of the licence

We were close to paying $4K per engineer for dbt Cloud just to unlock API access. Orchestra runs our dbt code straight from GitHub, and now we develop in Codespaces using the Power User extension for dbt.

That’s **$16K saved annually**.

1n06s7j,ETL vs ELT from Excel to Postgres,"Hello all, I’m working on a new project so I have an opportunity to set things up properly with best practices from the start. We will be ingesting a bunch of Excel files that have been cleaned to some extent, with the intention of storing the data into a Postgres DB. The headers have been standardised, although further cleaning and transformation needs to be done.

With this in mind, what might be a better approach to it?

1. Read in Python, preserving the data as strings, e.g. using a dataframe library like polars
2. Define tables in Postgres using SQLAlchemy, dump the data into a raw Postgres table
3. Clean and transform the data using something like dbt or SQLMesh to produce the final table that we want

Alternatively, another approach that I have in mind:

1. Read in Python, again preserving the data as strings
2. Clean and transform the columns in the dataframe library, and cast each column to the appropriate data type
3. Define Postgres tables with SQLAlchemy, then append the cleaned data into the table

Also, is Pydantic useful in either of these workflows for validating data types, or is it kinda superfluous since we are defining the data type on each column and casting appropriately?

1mzzeoq,Why aren’t incremental pipelines commonly built using MySQL binlogs for batch processing?,"Hi all,

I’m curious about the apparent gap in tooling around using database transaction logs (like MySQL binlogs) for **incremental batch processing**.

In our organization, we currently perform incremental loads directly from tables, relying on timestamp or “last modified” columns. This approach works, but it’s error-prone — for example, manual updates or overlooked changes sometimes don’t update these columns, causing data to be missed in our loads.

On the other hand, there are many streaming CDC solutions (Debezium, Kafka Connect, AWS DMS) that consume binlogs, but they feel overkill for small teams and require substantial operational overhead.

This leads me to wonder: why isn’t there a **more lightweight, batch-oriented binlog reader and parser** that could be used for incremental processing? Are there any existing tools or libraries that support this use case that I might be missing? I’m not considering commercial solutions like Fivetran due to cost constraints.

I have heard about columnar DBs and I chose to try Clickhouse, out of recommandations from blogs or specialized youtubers (and some LLMs to be 100% honest).
We are pretty amazed by its speed and the compression rate, it was pretty easy to do a quick setup using docker-compose. Features like materialized view or aggregating mergetrees seems also super interesting to us.

We have made the decision to incluse CH into our infrastructure, knowing that it's gonna be a key part for BI mostly (metrics coming from sensors mostly, with quite a lot of functional logic with time windows or contexts and so on).

The question is: how do we host this?
There isnt a single chance I can convince my boss to use a managed service, so we will use resources from a cloud provider.

What are you experiences with self-hosted CH? Would you recommend a replicated infrastructure with multiple containers based on docker-compose ? Do you think kubernetes is a good idea?
Also, if there are some downsides or drawbacks to clickhouse we should consider I am definitely up for some feedbacks on it!

[Edit] our data volume is currently about 30GB/day, using Clickhouse it goes down to ~1GB/day

1mzvh2e,Feeling stuck as a DA. Next steps?,"Hi everyone, I’m at a bit of a crossroads and would appreciate some advice.

I am a junior Data Analyst with about one year and a half in a smallish non-tech company, embedded in the sales/marketing department. Overall, my role feels pretty frustrating:

-There’s constant context switching between small urgent ad-hoc requests. The problem is that everything is urgent so it’s impossible to prioritize.

-A lot of these requests is just manual crap that no one else wants to do.

-A lot of deck formatting/power point monkey work where I spend more time aligning logos than doing actual analysis.

-Since I’m the only data person, no one really understands my struggles or can support my tasks, and when something that is easy on paper but tricky to implement, I cannot really easily pushback or manage expectations.

-Due to this chaotic environment, a lot of times I feel very stressed and overwhelmed.

-In summary, I feel more like a glorified commercial assistant or data-ticket monkey than a proper (aspiring) data professional.

That said, I do get some exposure to more interesting data topics. I collaborate with the central data team on things like dbt models, Power BI dashboards or Airflow orchestration, which has given me some hands-on experience with the modern data stack.

On top of that, I’m currently doing a Master’s in Data Science/AI which I’ll hopefully finish in less than a year. My dilemma: should I start looking for a new role now, try to get more interesting topics within my org (if possible) or wait until I finish the degree? On one hand, I feel burnt out and don’t see much growth in my current role. On the other hand, I don’t want to burn myself out with even more stress (applications, interviews, etc) when I already have a demanding day-to-day life. Has anyone been in a similar spot?

1mzp4y7,How are you handling slow HubSpot -> Snowflake historical syncs due to API limits?,"Hey everyone,

Hoping to learn from the community on a challenge we're facing with our HubSpot to Snowflake data pipeline.

**The Pain Point:** Our syncs are painfully slow whenever a schema change in HubSpot forces a historical resync of an entire object (like Contacts or Deals). We're talking days, not hours, for the sync to complete, which leaves our downstream dashboards and reports stale.

**Our Current Setup:**

* **Source:** HubSpot
* **Destination:** Snowflake
* **Integration Tool:** Airbyte
* **Sync Mode:** Incremental Append + Deduplication
* **Suspected Bottleneck:** We're almost certain this is due to the HubSpot API rate limits.

**My Questions for You:**

1. What tools or architectures are you using for this pipeline (Fivetran, Airbyte, Stitch, custom scripts, etc.)?
2. How do you manage HubSpot schema changes without triggering a full, multi-day table resync?
3. Are there any known workarounds for HubSpot's API limits, like using webhooks for certain events or exporting files to S3 first?
4. Is there a better sync strategy we should consider?

1mznsrq,Career Path After Senior Data Engineer - Seeking Advice,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about my long-term career path as a data engineer and could really use some perspective from the community.

I currently work as a data engineer at a large public company, and while I’m comfortable with my trajectory toward becoming a senior data engineer, I’m unsure about what comes after that.

On one hand, moving into staff, and principal engineer feels like the natural next step, but I’m not convinced it’s the right fit for me. My passion lies in data and AI, not necessarily in core engineering or people management. My background leans more toward the “type B” data engineer, I have an analytical, business-focused mindset and a love for working with data, rather than being deep into systems or heavy software engineering.

Lately, I’ve been considering a few possible paths:

* Pivoting into product management for data/AI products
* Transitioning into AI engineering and building more ML-focused skill sets
* Becoming a more well-rounded data engineer by leaning into software engineering skills
* Or perhaps focusing on strategy and leadership roles where I can influence how businesses create value with data rather than being hands-on with execution.

Ultimately, I know I want to become a leader in data or AI in 5 years issh (head of data, director of AI team), someone shaping direction and strategy rather than just pipelines, but I’m still unclear on what the right stepping stones are to get there.

If anyone has been through a similar crossroads, or has insights on the best ways to transition toward more strategic, data-driven leadership roles, I’d really appreciate your thoughts.

1mzd4gj,Stream realtime data into pinecone vector db,"Hey everyone, I've been working on a data pipeline to update AI agents and RAG applications’ knowledge base in real time.

Currently, most knowledgeable base enrichment is batch based . That means your Pinecone index lags behind—new events, chats, or documents aren’t searchable until the next sync. For live systems (support bots, background agents), this delay hurts.

To solve this I've developed a streaming pipeline that takes data directly from Kafka, generates embeddings on the fly, and upserts them into Pinecone continuously. With Kafka to pinecone template , you can plug in your Kafka topic and have Pinecone index updated with fresh data. 

- Agents and RAG apps respond with the latest context 
- Recommendations systems adapt instantly to new user activity

Any guidance, resources, or even examples of projects that would mimic a “real-world” Data Engineering environment would be super helpful.

Does anyone have any experience with DCR they can share in terms of high-level contract, legal, security, C level discussions, trust, outcomes, and how it went?

Technical implementation discussions welcome as well (regardless of the cloud provider).

1my2354,5 yoe data engineer but no warehousing experience,"Hey everyone,

I have 4.5 years of experience building  data pipelines and infrastructure using Python, AWS, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Airflow. I do not have experience with snowflake or DBT. I see a lot of job postings asking for those, so I plan to create full fledged projects (clear use case, modular, good design, e2e testing, dev-uat-prod, CI/CD, etc) and put it on GitHub. In your guys experience in the last 2 years, is it likely to break into roles using snowflake/DBT with the above approach? Or if not how would you recommend?

Appreciate it",66,Otherwise-Bonus-1752,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1my2354/5_yoe_data_engineer_but_no_warehousing_experience/,2025-08-23 13:54:25
1my12c3,Disaster recovery setup for end to end data pipeline,"Hello Experts,

Planning to have the disaster recovery(DR) setup for our end to end data pipeline which consists of both realtime ingestion and batch ingestion and transformation mainly using Snowflake tech. This consists of techs like kafka, snowpipe streaming for real time ingestion and also snowpipe/copy jobs for batch processing of files from AWS S3 and then Streams, Tasks, snowflake Dynamic tables for tramsformation. The snowflake account have multiple databases and in that multiple schemas exists but we only want to have the DR configuration done for critical schemas/tables and not full database.

Majority of the component hosted on the AWS cloud infrastructure. However, as mentioned this has also spanned across components which are lying outside the Snowflake like e.g kafka, Airflow scheduler etc. But also within snowflake we have warehouses , roles, stages which are in the same account but are not bound to a schema or database. And how these different components would be in synch during a DR exercise making sure no dataloss/corruption or if any failure/pause in the halfway in the data pipeline? I am going through the below document. Feels little lost when going through all of these. Wanted some guidance on , how we should proceed with this? Wants to understand, is there anything we should be cautious about and the approach we should take? Appreciate your guidance on this.

1mxzqt1,Built first data pipeline but i don't know if i did it right (BI analyst),"so i have built my first data pipeline with python (not sure if it's a pipeline or just an ETL) as a BI analyst since my company doesn't have a DE and i'm a data team of 1

i'm sure my code isn't the best thing in the world since it's mostly markdowns & block by block but here's the logic below, **please feel free to roast it** as much as you can  
  
also some questions   
  
\-how do you quality audit your own pipelines if you don't have a tutor ? 

\-what things should i look at and take care of ingeneral as a best practice?

# i asked AI to summarize it so here it is 

**Flow of execution:**

1. **Imports & Configs:**
   * Load necessary Python libraries.
   * Read environment variable for MotherDuck token.
   * Define file directories, target URLs, and date filters.
   * Define helper functions (`parse_uk_datetime`, `apply_transformations`, `wait_and_click`, `export_and_confirm`).
2. **Selenium automation:**
   * Open Chrome, maximize window, log in to dashboard.
   * Navigate through multiple customer interaction reports sections:
      * (Approved / Rejected)
      * (Verified / Escalated )
      * (Customer data profiles and geo locations)
   * Auto Enter date filters, auto click search/export buttons, and download Excel files.
3. **Excel processing:**
   * For each downloaded file, match it with a config.
   * Apply data type transformations 
   * Save transformed files to an output directory.
4. **Parquet conversion:**
   * Convert all transformed Excel files to Parquet for efficient storage and querying.
5. **Load to MotherDuck:**
   * Connect to the MotherDuck database using the token.
   * Loop through all Parquet files and create/replace tables in the database.
6. **SQL Table Aggregation & Power BI:**
   * Aggregate or transform loaded tables into **Power BI-ready tables** via SQL queries in MotherDuck.
   * build A to Z Data dashboard 
7. **Automated Data Refresh via Power Automate:**
   * automated reports sending via **Power Automate** & to trigger the refresh of the Power BI dataset automatically after new data is loaded.
8. **Slack Bot Integration:**
   * Send daily summaries of data refresh status and key outputs to Slack, ensuring the team is notified of updates.",31,NotABusinessAnalyst,162,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1mxzqt1/built_first_data_pipeline_but_i_dont_know_if_i/,2025-08-23 12:09:13
1mxxx07,Built an AI Data Pipeline MVP that auto-generates PySpark code from natural language - how to add self-healing capabilities?,"What it does:

Takes natural language tickets (""analyze sales by region"")
Uses LangChain agents to parse requirements and generate PySpark code. Runs pipelines through Prefect for orchestration. Multi-agent system with data profiling, transformation, and analytics agents


The question: How can I integrate self-healing mechanisms?

Right now if a pipeline fails, it just logs the error. I want it to automatically:

Detect common failure patterns
Retry with modified parameters
Auto-fix data quality issues
Maybe even regenerate code if schema changes
Has anyone implemented self-healing in Prefect workflows? 

Thinking about:

Any libraries, patterns, or architectures you'd recommend? Especially interested in how to make the AI agents ""learn"" from failures, any more ideas or feature I can integrate here

1mxrtmu,How would you build a database from an API that has no order tracking status?,"I am building a database from a trusted API where it has data like

>item name, revenue, quantity, transaction id, etc.

Unfortunately the API source does not have any order status tracking. A slight issue is some reports need real time data and they will be run on 1st day of the month. How would you build your database from it if you want to have both the historical and current (new) data?

**Sample:**

Assume today is 9/1/25 and the data I need on my reports are:

* Aug 2025
* Sep 2024
* Oct 2024



Should you:

* (A) do an ETL/ELT where the date argument is today and have a separate logic that keeps finding duplicates on a daily basis
* (B) have a delay on the ETL/ELT orchestration where the API call will have 2-3 days delay as arguments before passing them to the db



I feel like option B is the safer answer, where I will get the >!last\_month!< data via API call and then the >!last\_year!< data from the db I made and cleaned.
